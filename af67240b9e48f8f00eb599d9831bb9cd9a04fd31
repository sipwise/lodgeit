This is fine but it makes the rest of this document wrong as it says to call \"scripts/make-bootstrap.py\" which is now \"lodgeit/scripts...\".\n\nI\u0027d suggest doing:\n  git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack-infra/lodgeit .\n\nOr otherwise instruct the user to do the clone and then change into the (lodgeit) folder ommitting the part of creating a new lodgeit-dev folder.",
